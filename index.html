				<p>
					First Christmas 
					I gave you my heart 
					But the very next day 
					You gave it away 
					This year 
					To save me from tears 
					I'll give it to someone special
				</p>
				<p>
					Once bitten and twice shy 
					I keep my distance 
					But you still catch my eye 
					Tell me baby 
					Do you recognize me? 
					Well 
					It's been a year 
					It doesn't surprise me
				</p>
				<p>
					I wrapped it up and sent it 
					With a note saying "I love you" 
					I meant it 
					Now I know what a fool I've been 
					But if you kissed me now 
					I know you'd fool me again
